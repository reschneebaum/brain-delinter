#  ðŸ§  Delinter
### Brain delinter helps move all the lint â€”â€” those thoughts and thought-spirals that can fill your brain and wake you up at night â€”â€” out of your head and into your device!

The app's main feature is a single, infinite list (called a 'lint list' so as not to bring up any stressful/negative feelings about to-do lists)
1. Throughout the day, add anything that comes up or pops into your brain to your lint list
    - note: the aim is to make adding a list item as easy and intuitive as possible; it should feel second-nature, the digital equivalent of writing a number on your hand. some current and/or future potential ideas include:
      - widgets
      - siri ("hey siri, add 'pay electricity bill' to my lint list")
      - app intent
      - shortcut
2. At the same time each day, you'll receive a notification(/hear an alarm?), which is your cue to spend 20 minutes going through the list and crossing things off. 
3. When the 20 minutes is up, a second alarm goes off: congrats, you're done! And hella accomplished. 
4. Any remaining list items roll over and can be tackled tomorrow

## Ideas for future development
 - calendar that keeps track of streaks, productive days, 'you showed up anyway' days, etc
 - notification settings so you can choose your preferred method, optional sound, etc etc
 - easy + expansive support for sharing your accomplishments â€”â€” by email, text, on social media, with your provider, etc
 - would be nice to send additional notifications (?) to remind and/or congratulate
