#  ðŸ§  Delinter
## Brain delinter helps move the clutter/static/lint out of your brain and into your phone!
1. Throughout the day, add anything that comes up or pops into your brain to a single, infinite list.
2. At the same time each day, you'll receive a notification(/hear an alarm?), which is your cue to spend 20 minutes going through the list and crossing things off. 
3. When the 20 minutes is up, a second alarm goes off: congrats, you're done! And hella accomplished. 
4. Now any remaining list items roll over

- single todo list
    - can be renamed(?)
    - must be extremely easy to add things (shortcut, siri, widget, etc)
    - should be very satisfying to cross things off (custom animations?)
    
- 2 alarms: one at your (customizable) start-doing time; one when it's time to stop
    - actual alarm (is this possible?) or push notification or something?
    - adjustable
    - snoozeable(?)
    - can be turned off/on (in case you're on vacation or don't want to do it some day or whatever)

- would be nice to send additional notifications (?) to remind and/or congratulate

## Other ideas
 - calendar that keeps track of streaks, productive days, 'you showed up anyway' days, etc
 - notification settings so you can choose your preferred method, whether you want sound or text, etc etc
 - way to share your accomplishments on social media (/ with a dr)
